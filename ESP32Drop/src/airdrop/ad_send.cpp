 * silently if changed: TransferID is a DICT and not a string (a string was closed on
 * without an answer), Items is an empty array, /Upload's TotalBytes is the FILE size and
 * not the body length (the body length made the peer wait for bytes that never came). What
 * is NOT here is equally measured: no client certificate, no SenderRecordData, no FileIcon,
 * no SenderIdentityAuthTag. All four were tried and none is required.
 *
 * The structure is a state machine because /Ask waits for a human. Each stage opens its own
 * connection -- as the real sender does -- and each poll advances one step of one stage.

 *
 * What that cost: this translation unit carries about 22 KB of static internal DRAM (a
 * 16 KB request buffer, a 3 KB response buffer, a bplist writer and the headers), and
 * internal RAM is the resource this library actually runs out of -- 2,088 bytes of added
 * static has already been enough, once, to stop mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed() and make the
 * device silently undiscoverable. A receiver build has no business reserving any of it.
 *
 * The header stays unconditional on purpose: declarations cost nothing, and a caller that
 * uses them in a build without the define gets a link error naming the function it wanted,
 * which is a better answer than a compile error naming a missing header. */

   * Bisected: an EMPTY SenderRecordData is the whole difference. FileIcon changes nothing

   * past the end of the capture, and transfers complete without it.

 * the same verdict the hardware-proven path used -- it had no other gate and reached /Ask
 * on every run. IsAirDropable has never been observed false in this project, so nothing is
 * currently known to be lost; if a peer that answers 200 can still refuse, this will report
 * it as sendable and /Ask will be the one to say no.
