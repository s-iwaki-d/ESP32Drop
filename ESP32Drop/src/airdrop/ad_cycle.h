/* ad_cycle.h -- the BLE/AWDL alternation a sender has to perform, and the measured
 * constants that make it work.
 *
 * A sender cannot simply come up and transmit. Two facts force a cycle:
 *
 *   1. The peer's AirDrop listener is not running until a BLE Continuity advertisement
 *      wakes it. That the advertisement is what does it was established by elimination:
 *      unicast mDNS queries for _airdrop._tcp were fired at three peers every six seconds
 *      for seven minutes and not one listener appeared, and this badge had been naming
 *      _airdrop._tcp in its own AWDL service TLV for hours without waking anybody.
 *
 *   2. BLE and AWDL cannot both be resident. The BLE controller costs about 26 KB of
 *      internal DRAM and AWDL about 110 KB, and a device that holds both has nothing left
 *      for the application -- which is the whole objection to a protocol library that
 *      consumes the device.
 *
 * So: advertise, tear BLE down and release it, bring AWDL up, watch for someone close,
 * send, tear AWDL down, repeat. This module owns that loop so a sketch does not have to
 * rediscover the four timings or hand-assemble the 24-byte advertisement -- a single
 * missing length byte in that payload produced four cycles of silent failure, with
 * bleadv_begin() returning success the whole time.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS WHOLE MODULE IS A SENDER'S. It compiles only under ESP32DROP_SENDER, along with
 * the bundled BLE advertiser it drives. A receiving build carries neither -- not the code,
 * not the controller, and not the btInUse() override that would otherwise keep about 36 KB
 * reserved for a radio that build never turns on.

 * reads an AD element of length 0xFF and discards the whole advertisement.

/* HOW LONG TO ADVERTISE.
 *
 * There is no constant here for "how long the peer takes to wake", and that is deliberate:
 * the figure this file used to carry was never measured against the advertisement starting,
 * so quoting it at all invited it to be built on again.
 *
 * What is observed: one second is enough. At the 30 ms interval both captured Apple devices
 * use, a second is about thirty advertising events. Transfers complete through /Discover,
 * /Ask, a human Accept and /Upload on peers woken this way, and when a peer does NOT wake
 * the reason has not been duration -- an iPhone with its screen locked does not wake however
 * long the advertisement runs, and with the screen on it is ready at once. One capture holds
 * both outcomes against the same peer, one cycle apart, with the same advertisement.
 *
 * Being wrong here is cheap and loud: a peer that needed longer simply does not answer, and
 * that reads as "too late - they slept". Being wrong the other way is expensive and silent
 * -- BLE and AWDL cannot both be resident, so every second spent advertising is a second
 * the badge cannot see anybody at all. */

/* HOW LATE A CONNECT CAN STILL BE ACCEPTED, measured from the instant the advertisement
 * STOPPED -- which is the only instant any of this is measured from on the peer's side.
 *
 * The two platforms hold their listener open for very different times after the advert
 * stops. Measured with a bare-connect probe every two seconds across a whole window:
 *
 *     macOS   open for the whole 40 s window -- 134 probes, not one refusal
 *     iOS     open to about 25 s, then refused: 25-30 s went 1 open / 16 refused
 *
 * Distance had nothing to do with it: 1.6 dB between the average RSSI of an accepted and
 * a refused probe. It is purely elapsed time.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS USED TO BE COUNTED FROM THE WRONG INSTANT, and the arithmetic that justified it
 * was wrong in a way that made the code look safe. The reasoning was "20 s keeps every
 * attempt inside both, with 5 s of margin under the iOS cliff" -- true only if the watch
 * begins when the advertisement stops. It does not: LOCKING sits in between, and it was a
 * fixed 12 s. So connects were attempted between advert_stop + 12 s and advert_stop + 32 s,
 * the last seven seconds of every single cycle were past the point where an iPhone refuses,
 * and the stated margin did not exist anywhere in the window. The failure it produced is
 * the worst kind: a send that did everything right and died on ECONNRESET at the last
 * connect, with a phone sitting in front of the device.
 *
 * 20 s from advert stop keeps the author's intended 5 s of margin, now under the number it
 * was always meant to be under. LOCKING is adaptive as well (see AD_CYCLE_LOCK_MS), so the
 * settling time is no longer spent whole and the usable watch is longer than it was even
 * while being safer. */

 * completed, and a connection has been observed alive 47 seconds in. So a large file is not
 * what breaks a send.
 *
 * What must all land inside the window are the three connects -- /Discover, /Ask and
 * /Upload each open their own -- and the human's Accept sits between the second and the
 * third. Measured accepts run from 4 to 47 seconds. A person who takes twenty seconds
 * pushes the /Upload connect past the point where an iPhone still accepts one, and the send
 * fails with ECONNRESET at the last stage having done everything else right.
 *
 * That is the real cost of three connections, and it is why they are worth revisiting if
 * iOS ever turns out to accept a reused one. */
