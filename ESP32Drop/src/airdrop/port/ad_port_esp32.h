 * never raises it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS YOURS TO SET. Decoding happens while the body arrives, so the library holds
 * one block about the size of the finished archive for the length of a transfer. Left to
 * itself it takes nearly all of PSRAM -- which is right for a badge that does nothing else
 * and wrong for a sketch that wants a framebuffer, a sound sample or a log of its own.
 * Whoever wrote the sketch knows which; the library does not.
 *
 * A transfer larger than this is refused with HTTP 413 to the sender, so the Mac says the
 * transfer failed instead of appearing to succeed. That is a policy limit and it is
 * reported as one; running out of memory below the limit is a different fact and answers
 * 507. ad_stats_read() publishes the effective ceiling, which may be lower than you asked
 * for if PSRAM could not supply it.
 *
 * Sizes worth knowing, all measured: a 2.4 MB photo decodes to a 2,354,688-byte archive;
 * the largest free PSRAM block on an ESP32-S3R8 with this firmware is 7,864,308 B, and once
 * the residue buffer and RX_OUT_HEADROOM are taken out there is room for about 7.1 MB of
