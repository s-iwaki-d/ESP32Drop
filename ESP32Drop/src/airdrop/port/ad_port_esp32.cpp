/* ⚠️ THE RECEIVING HALF, AND IT IS ABSENT FROM A SENDER BUILD.
 *
 * Everything below compiles only when ESP32DROP_SENDER is NOT defined. The two roles cannot
 * share a device -- a listener task's 32,768-byte stack and a sender's lifelong TLS client
 * context do not both fit beside AWDL with anything left for an application -- so the build
 * decides which one exists instead of leaving a runtime flag to catch the mistake later.
 *
 * What a sender build stops carrying, measured: 5,662 bytes of static allocation
 * (g_adlog 1,616, ad_respond's frame 1,440, g_ssl 552, g_entropy 420, g_srvcert 408,
 * g_disc_body 320, g_ask_body 256, g_tlsconf 196, and the rest), plus every byte of the
 * receive path's code. More importantly it stops carrying ad_begin() itself: a send sketch
 * that called it by mistake would take a 32 KB task stack at runtime and only find out by
 * running short of memory somewhere else. Now it will not link, which is the earliest
 * possible place to be told.
 *
 * The symmetry is deliberate: ad_cycle.cpp and the bundled BLE advertiser are absent from a
 * RECEIVING build for exactly the same reason, in exactly the same way.

 *
 * It is also not load-bearing, which is what makes its absence a decision rather than a
 * hole:
 *   - Every record it carried, all twelve, is carried by the REPLY below -- ad_respond()
 *     does not look at the question and returns the same message.
 *   - Peers do ask. 387 decoded queries from the capture corpus: 186 for the _airdrop PTR,
 *     184 each for the two pairing service PTRs, 178 for our A record.
 *   - Across 35 separate runs in which mDNS was physically silent, 228 TCP connections
 *     were accepted and six uploads completed.
 *   - Discovery is carried by the AWDL service_response TLVs in every MIF action frame
 *     (awdl_frame.h), which do go out, 3.8 times a second.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GIVES UP, stated plainly: reaching a peer that has NOT asked. Nothing in the
 * record required that, but nothing in the record TESTED it either -- every capture is of
 * a device that had seen this badge before. A cold, never-paired device is the experiment
 * that could overturn this, and it is why this reasoning is written down rather than left
 * implicit in an absent function.
 *
 * The announce hook is deliberately kept: awdl_set_announce_cb() exists, the cadence fires
 * it in-window, and nothing registers. Its contract -- that awdl_tx_ip6_now() is legal for
 * the duration of the call -- is independently true and measured. What cannot be done is
 * the multicast destination, not the mechanism.

/* ---- staged diagnostics: the library does not own Serial ------------------------
 *
 * Every diagnostic line the AirDrop layer produces is now COPIED INTO A RING and written
 * out by whoever calls ad_diag_read_line() -- in practice the sketch's loop(). Three
 * reasons, in order of how much they cost when ignored:
 *
 * 1. A library must not decide that a user's Serial port is its log. There is no
 *    setLogSink() either: a sink is a callback, a callback runs on whatever task called
 *    it, and USBCDC::write busy-spins without yielding for up to 250 ms
 *    (cores/esp32/USBCDC.cpp) -- fifteen times one AW. Pull, never push.
 * 2. These lines were written from the TLS task. Serial.printf is not atomic, and this
 *    project has already lost the single line of evidence for a regression to two
 *    interleaved writes.
 * 3. Dropping is correct when the ring is full, and is counted. Blocking a protocol task
 *    to wait for a UART is how a diagnostic becomes an outage.
 *
 * SPSC, one producer (the TLS task) and one consumer, using the same cursor and the same
 * barrier discipline as the frame ring -- awdl_ring.h, which has 19 host checks. That is
 * the ONE thing this file takes from the AWDL layer, through the public header, which is
 * exactly what the layering rule in tools/check-library.sh permits.
 */
/* -DAD_DIAG_DETAIL turns on the instruments that answer OPEN QUESTIONS rather than report
 * the device's state: the TLS session-cache probes, the listener's stack high-water sample,
 * and the once-a-second listener-loop line. It is off by default because the ring below
 * holds eight slots and a per-second producer spends one of them every second -- the lines
 * a reader actually came for are the rare ones, and they are the ones a steady drip evicts.
 * Nothing outside this file's diagnostics changes with it: no frame is built differently,
 * no byte is parsed differently, and no counter reported through ad_stats_read() moves. */

 *
 * IT SITS IN http_src_mbedtls(), on the one path every decrypted byte takes, so it cannot

 * hex number ("req 1F7BB"). A tap anywhere off the byte path cannot find that.
 *
 * DECRYPTED, unlike AIRDROP_CH_DUMP -- that one wraps the net BIO and therefore sees
 * ciphertext plus the plaintext ClientHello, which answers a different question.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OUTPUT CONTAINS THE SENDER'S APPLE ID VALIDATION RECORD. It is capture of a
 * real person's identity material. It belongs in logs/ (which .gitignore excludes) and
 * MUST NOT be committed, and must not go into testdata/ even scrubbed.
 *

// whole archive; ad_poll() walks it on the caller's task and hands over every
// regular file it holds. No type is privileged and none is discarded here -- the
// archive may carry several files and the sketch gets each one. All large buffers
// live in PSRAM (8MB); the TLS task never touches the display.

// Buffered reader over the TLS session so we can de-chunk byte-accurately. It is
// primed with any body bytes the header read already pulled in (`pre`), then
// pulls the rest from mbedtls_ssl_read. (The reader itself lives in ad_http.h so
// Arduino's auto-prototype pass sees the type -- see the note there.)
// ---- streaming DvZip decode ----------------------------------------------------
// The record framing and the drain live in ../core/ad_dvzip.h and are host-tested
// there. What is here is the part that genuinely needs the platform -- miniz and
// PSRAM -- and the policy for when either runs out.
//
// WHY THE DECODE MOVED INTO THE SINK. The order used to be: receive the whole
// compressed body -> answer 200 -> decode -> maybe fail. A PSRAM exhaustion during
// that decode was unreportable -- the 200 was already gone -- and the
// consequence was visible: the badge showed the transfer dead while the Mac sat on "Sending",
// then reported success. Decoding record by record WHILE receiving puts every
// decode failure BEFORE the response, where it is a receipt failure and is answered
// as 507/413/400. It also stops holding the compressed and decoded copies at once,
// which raises the transfer ceiling from ~3.7 MB to roughly the PSRAM free block
// minus the residue buffer (~7.1 MB) as a side effect.
//
// The response is NOT delayed by this, and that constraint is load-bearing: a
// response one window late is a transfer sharingd abandons (see ad_serve.h). The
// per-record inflate (~131 KB grain) costs tens of ms interleaved into a
// multi-second receive, and the only decode left between the last byte and the
// response is the held-back residue -- at most one record. The whole-body decode
// that used to sit after the response is exactly what this design removes.

// server was always stuck waiting on a dead connection while the live CH rotted
// unread. Here every fd is O_NONBLOCK; we select() over all of them, adopt the
// NEWEST fd that has a queued ClientHello (MSG_PEEK), step the handshake without
// blocking, and preempt a silent active connection if a newer one gets a CH.
// ClientHello witness: wrap the handshake-phase recv BIO and hexdump the first
// CH_DUMP_MAX bytes of each adopted connection's inbound stream ("CH <ms> off=N <hex>").
// This is the discriminating measurement for the cycle-start resumption misses: the
// CH is plaintext, so its session_id + extensions (supported_versions 0x2b, key_share
// 0x33, session_ticket 0x23, ALPN 0x10) settle at once (a) whether the unknown IDs
// are TLS1.3-compat random fill, (b) whether enabling server tickets could even
// negotiate, (c) whether ALPN/False Start is on the table, (d) whether the client
// offers TLS1.3 at all. Dumping the byte STREAM (not per-segment) reassembles a CH
// split across segments for free. The inbound segment ceiling is ~1220 B [D] -- the
// 1280-byte AWDL path MTU less 40 bytes of IPv6 and 20 of TCP header; nothing on this
// path records an actual inbound segment length, so that figure is arithmetic, not a
// measurement. 1600B may truncate an oversized CH -- the offline parser sees the
// record length and flags it; bump the cap and re-measure if that happens.
// Runs in tcp_listen_task (not process_frame),

/* THE LISTENER'S ACTUAL STACK NEED. SETTLED: 32,768 allocated, 17,348 used at the peak.
 *
 * The task is created with 32,768 bytes. It was raised there from 4,096 because the mbedTLS
 * handshake overflowed the smaller stack and crashed, which establishes 4,096 is too little. What is enough is the measurement above: a real
 * transfer peaks at 17,348 bytes used, so 32,768 carries roughly 15 KB of headroom. The
 * number is worth having because the reserve is expensive -- 32,768 CONTIGUOUS bytes of
 * internal RAM is the largest single allocation the library makes, out of the same heap
 * mbedTLS wants two ~16.6 KB blocks from, so a sketch that fails to start the listener is
 * short of contiguous internal heap rather than of stack.
 *
 * Because the answer is known, the SAMPLING is behind AD_DIAG_DETAIL. It was the first
 * statement of the select loop's for(;;), so it ran ~10 times a second for the life of the
 * device to re-derive a constant. With the define off nothing writes g_ls_stack_min and
 * ad_listen_stack_min_free() reports 0, which is exactly what it reports before the task
 * has run; re-open the question by rebuilding with -DAD_DIAG_DETAIL.
 *
 * It is the minimum over the task's life, not the instant value: a handshake's peak is what
 * matters and it is over in a second. uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark returns BYTES on
 * ESP-IDF, not words, whatever the AWDL layer's function name suggests. */
