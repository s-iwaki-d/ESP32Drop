// AirDrop HTTP/1.1 stream layer: the chunked reader and everything that decides
// where a request boundary is.
//
// Dependency-free integer C over a single abstract byte source, so the SAME code
// compiles into the firmware and into a host test (tools/test-http.sh) that replays
// scripted byte streams with scripted arrival TIMES. The timing is the point: every
// bug this layer has produced was a timeout interacting with chunked framing, and
// none of them is reachable without modelling when bytes arrive.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE INVARIANT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A read that consumes bytes and then stops for any reason OTHER than the parser's
// own delimiter -- a timeout, an EOF, a short read, a line with no terminator --
// has left the byte stream at an unknown offset. TLS provides no framing above it
// to resynchronise against, so the stream is finished: the only legal operation
// afterwards is close. That is `poisoned`, and it is enforced HERE, in the reader,
// not at the call sites -- the bug that motivated it was created by tuning a
// timeout at a call site, and a rule living at call sites is a rule the next
// timeout tweak can quietly reopen.
//
// What that bug was, for the record. sharingd sends /Ask with a ~129KB chunked body
// (a PKCS#7 Apple-ID validation record plus a FileIcon preview). Answering /Ask and
// then draining that body with a 400ms budget read ZERO bytes -- the body had not
// begun arriving, the link's RTT being 0.4-1.0s -- and the code then looped and read
// the body's first chunk header, "1F7BB", as an HTTP request line. It 404'd into the
// middle of somebody's body and closed. The transfer died with the badge showing
// "Receiving 0kB" while the Mac showed the send as complete.
