/* ad_zlib.h -- emit a valid zlib stream with NO compressor.
 *
 * The AirDrop SEND path has to produce DvZip records: [BE32 length][zlib chunk].
 * The receive path already gets DEflate for free from the ESP32-S3 mask ROM
 * (tinfl_decompress_mem_to_mem, used by the receive path). The send path needs the
 * opposite direction, and the obvious answers are both bad:
 *
 *   - The ROM also exports tdefl_* (verified: esp32s3.rom.ld "Group miniz",
 *     tdefl_compress_mem_to_mem = 0x400007d4). But sizeof(tdefl_compressor) is
 *     167,744 bytes and the receiver runs with 29.7-37.6 KB of free internal heap
 *     (measured, logs/soakB_d1.txt). It does not fit.
 *   - Vendoring a deflate implementation is against org policy and would be ~1500
 *     lines to compress data that does not compress.
 *
 * Neither is needed. DEFLATE has a STORED block type (BTYPE=00) that copies bytes
 * through verbatim, so a conforming zlib stream can be emitted with a header, a
 * length, and a checksum -- no dictionary, no hash table, no allocation.
 *
 * MEASURED, not asserted (see tools/test-zlib.sh):
 * round-tripped byte-exact through real zlib -- both zlib.decompress and the
 * streaming decompressobj path a receiver uses -- at n = 0, 1, 100, 65534, 65535,
 * 65536, 131070, 200000.
 *
 * Is giving up compression a real cost? No, for this payload. A real Apple sender's
 * own deflate saved 1,719 bytes out of 266,752 on a captured PNG transfer = 0.64%,
 * because the payload was already compressed. Stored blocks cost +0.012% on the same
 * data. At the measured 5.7-26 KB/s link that difference is +0.07 to +0.3 seconds
 * against an effective RTT of ~1 second.
 *
 * Dependency-free integer C, in the house style: it compiles unchanged into the
 * firmware and into tools/test-zlib.sh.
