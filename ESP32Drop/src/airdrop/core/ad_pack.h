/* ad_pack.h -- build the cpio archive an AirDrop SENDER has to deliver.
 *
 * The last piece of the /Upload body. The other two already exist and are measured:
 * ad_zlib.h emits a conforming zlib stream out of DEFLATE stored blocks (no compressor,
 * no allocation -- the ROM's tdefl wants 167,744 bytes of state and does not fit), and
 * adz_dvzip_record() wraps one in the [BE32 length][zlib] framing a receiver expects.
 * What was missing is the archive inside.
 *
 * THE FORMAT IS NOT GUESSED. Every field below is copied off a real Apple sender's own
 * bytes, from testdata/dvzip_body.bin -- a captured /Upload body:
 *
 *   magic    '070707'      dev  '000000'   ino '000002'   mode '100644'
 *   uid      '000765'      gid  '000024'   nlink '000001' rdev '000000'
 *   mtime    '15245051022' namesize '000021' filesize '00000001135'
 *   name     './._IMG_7495.JPG\0'
 *
 *   ...and the archive ends with, exactly:
 *   magic '070707' dev '000000' ino '000003' mode '000000' uid '000000' gid '000000'
 *   nlink '000001' rdev '000000' mtime '00000000000' namesize '000013'
 *   filesize '00000000000'   name 'TRAILER!!!\0'
 *
 * ⚠️ uid 0765 and gid 0024 are 501 and 20 -- the SENDING HUMAN's real uid and gid. Those
 * are not ours to copy: a badge has no user. This writes 0/0, which a receiver reads as
 * root and does not care about, and which leaks nothing about anybody.
 *
 * WHAT A TRANSFER LOOKS LIKE. Measured across all thirteen archives in the capture
 * corpus, every one had exactly two entries: a '.' directory and one './name' file
 * (ad_cpio.h's own note). So that is the shape emitted here.
 * ⚠️ The '.' entry's permission bits are [A]: only its TYPE bits were ever observed to
 * matter (ad_cpio.h filters on AD_CPIO_S_IFDIR), and no capture in this tree shows the
 * directory header itself. 040755 is the conventional value.
 *
 * Dependency-free integer C, in the house style: the same code compiles into the firmware
 * and into tools/test-pack.sh, where the output is checked by macOS's own cpio(1) --
 * an implementation that is not this one, which is the only kind of golden worth having.
