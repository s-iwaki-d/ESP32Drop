/* DvZip record framing -- the outer structure of an AirDrop /Upload body.
 *
 * The body is a run of records, each a 4-byte big-endian header followed by that many
 * bytes of payload. Decompression is NOT here: it needs miniz, which is platform code,
 * and keeping the framing separate is what lets the framing be tested on a host against
 * captured Apple traffic. This header depends on nothing but <stdint.h>/<stdbool.h>.
 *
 * WHAT BIT 31 OF A RECORD HEADER MEANS -- settled by capture.
 *
 * It means the record is STORED: the payload is that many literal bytes, not a zlib stream.
 * The low 31 bits are the byte count either way.
 *
 * A macOS sender switches to stored records when deflate stops paying. Measured on a real
 * 2,352,508-byte body carrying a 2.35 MB photo (testdata/dvzip_census.inc is its shape with
 * the payloads removed; the body itself is somebody's photograph and is not in this
 * repository):
 *
 *     records  0..11   header 0x0001f6c9, 0x0002002e, ...   payload begins 78 9c
 *                      deflated, each inflating to exactly 131,072 bytes
 *     records 12..17   header 0x80020000 (and 0x8001ee00 last)
 *                      payload begins a2 a8, f1 5b, 61 9e, 7f d3, 4f 75, de 95 -- no zlib
 *                      header anywhere, high entropy, stored verbatim
 *     18 records consume 2,352,508 of 2,352,508 bytes and produce 2,354,688, which is a
 *     complete odc cpio ending in TRAILER!!!
 *
 * The record grain is 128 KiB of UNCOMPRESSED data throughout -- the last record is short
 * because the archive is. This also kills the two rival readings the byte counts could not
 * separate: the payloads carry no zlib header, so a flagged record is not still deflated;
 * and a 4-byte header walk lands exactly on the end across all 18 records, so there is no
 * extended 8-byte header.
 *
 * Before that capture this file returned the whole 32-bit word as a length, which made
 * every flagged record read as a 2 GiB demand and cut the stream. That is why a 2.4 MB
 * photo arrived as "archive truncated" while a small one worked: a small photo never gives
 * deflate enough to lose on.

 * Streaming drain: consume complete records from the FRONT of a buffer that is still
 * being filled.
 *
 * WHY. The receive path used to buffer the whole compressed body, answer 200, and only
 * then decode -- so a PSRAM exhaustion during decode happened AFTER the only moment it
 * could have been reported, and the sender was told "success" about a transfer this
 * device had already lost. Decoding record by record WHILE the body arrives moves every
 * decode failure to before the response, where it can be answered honestly. Records are
 * safe to decode in isolation because each is self-contained: a complete zlib stream,
 * or literal bytes (bit 31) -- largest compressed payload measured 131,118 B at the
 * 128 KiB grain.
 *
 * THE HOLD-BACK RULE, which is the one subtlety: the last complete record is NOT
 * consumed until at least one byte follows it (or `final` is set). The completion probe
 * (dvzip_complete in ad_http.h) judges the UNCONSUMED bytes, and it can only recognise
 * "boundary-aligned, maybe done" if a record is still there to land on, and "end
 * record, certainly done" if the zero header is still there to read. The zero record is
 * never consumed for the same reason. So a consuming caller's residue is bounded by one
 * complete record plus one partial record (~262 KiB at the measured grain) and is never
 * empty once anything has arrived -- which is exactly the invariant dvzip_complete was
 * written against, so its verdict on the residue equals its verdict on the whole body.
 *
 * `emit` is called once per consumed record with its in-buffer payload; returning false
 * stops the walk and the record is NOT counted as consumed, so no bytes are lost.
 * Returns the bytes consumed from buf[0..], whole records only -- buf+consumed is again
 * a record boundary and the caller compacts (memmove) by that much. *end reports why
 * the walk stopped: AD_DVZIP_END_RUNNING when this call stopped it (hold-back or emit
 * refusal), the iterator's verdict otherwise. Mid-stream, END_CUT is EXPECTED -- the
 * tail record simply has not finished arriving -- and only a `final` walk may read it
 * as damage. */
