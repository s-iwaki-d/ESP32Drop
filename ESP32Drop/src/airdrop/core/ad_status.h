/* ad_status.h -- the AirDrop layer's answer to "how far did it get".
 *
 * The sibling of awdl_status.h, and it exists for the same reason: the layer below
 * already had a pull API, this one did not, so the sketch read twenty of its internal
 * globals directly. draw()'s own comment claimed the badge's screen "runs off the PUBLIC
 * status and nothing else" -- measured, six of its seven ladder rungs were reading
 * private AirDrop counters. This is that API.
 *
 * WHY COUNTERS AND NOT A BOOLEAN. "AirDrop doesn't work" is never one failure. A sender
 * has to find us over mDNS, open TCP, complete a TLS handshake, be answered on
 * /Discover, be answered on /Ask, and only then upload. Each stage is strictly harder to
 * reach than the one before it, so the LAST one that moved says where it stopped -- which
 * turns "it doesn't work" into "it stops after TLS", and that is a different bug report.
 *
 * Dependency-free C, so the same code compiles into the firmware and into a host test.
