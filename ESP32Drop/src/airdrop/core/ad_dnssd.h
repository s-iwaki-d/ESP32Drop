/* ad_dnssd.h -- mDNS / DNS-SD codec.
 *
 * First piece: the Known-Answer decision. RFC 6762 section 7.1 says a responder MUST NOT
 * answer a question whose answer is already in the query's Known-Answer list, provided
 * that known answer still has at least half the responder's TTL. We have never honoured
 * it, and it is not a nicety here -- a reply is 1,107 bytes built and injected from the
 * frame task, measured at 3,400-7,379 us against a 319 us baseline, up to 45% of one AW.
 *
 * Measured over 101 real captured queries: 23 of them (23%) carry every record we would
 * send, so under 7.1 we should have stayed silent and instead sent the lot. A further 62
 * (61%) ask about nothing of ours at all and are answered only because the firmware's
 * filter is a raw "_airdrop" substring test -- that is a SEPARATE defect with its own
 * build, and this file deliberately does not act on it: when nothing of ours is asked,
 * the answer here is "not suppressed", leaving today's behaviour exactly as it is.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DANGEROUS CODE, and how it is guarded. Every failure mode of a suppression
 * bug points the same way: the badge quietly stops answering and quietly stops being
 * discoverable. This project has had that failure twice and both times a human noticed
 * before any instrument did. So the rule here is deliberately conservative -- suppress
 * only when EVERY record we would send is provably already held, never on a partial
 * match, never on a parse we could not complete, and never for a question type we
 * cannot reason about. Anything unrecognised returns false and we reply as before.
 *
 * Dependency-free integer C: it compiles unchanged into the firmware and into
 * tools/test-dnssd.sh, where the fixtures are real queries captured off the air.
