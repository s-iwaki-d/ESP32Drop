/* ad_send.h -- send a file to a nearby Apple device over AirDrop.
 *
 * The receiving half of this library answers AirDrop; this half initiates it. They do not
 * coexist on one device: a sender holds a TLS client context for its whole life and a
 * receiver holds a listener task with a 32 KB stack, and the two together do not fit
 * alongside AWDL with anything left for an application. Whichever role begins first owns
 * the device; the other returns AD_SEND_E_ROLE.
 *
 * WHAT A SEND ACTUALLY INVOLVES, because the API only makes sense against it:
 *
 *   1. The peer's AirDrop listener is not running until a Continuity BLE advertisement
 *      wakes it, and it closes again some time after that advertisement stops. How long
 *      either takes is not something this library claims to know -- see ad_cycle.h, which
 *      owns the alternation. This file assumes AWDL is up and the peer awake.
 *   2. /Discover, /Ask and /Upload each ride their OWN TLS connection, which is what a real
 *      macOS sender does. Three connects, three handshakes.
 *   3. /Ask makes the peer show its Accept dialog. A human then presses a button, or does
 *      not. Measured waits run from 4 s to 47 s, and "never" is a normal outcome.
 *
 * Point 3 is why this is asynchronous. Blocking for 47 s would freeze a sketch's screen and
 * buttons, and no Arduino user expects a call to do that. ad_send() returns immediately and
 * ad_send_poll() advances one step per call -- the same verb, on the same task, as the receiving
 * side. No thread is created: the largest contiguous internal block just after AWDL comes
 * up has been measured as low as 16,372 bytes, so a task stack here would come straight out
 * of the application's share.

                            NULL means decide from the leading bytes, which works for

                            cannot name is refused with AD_SEND_E_TYPE rather than
                            labelled by guess, and so is a MIME type this library has no
                            UTI for, and so is a type the bytes provably contradict:
                            "image/png" over a JPEG does not go out.

                            The MIME-to-UTI table is core/ad_uti.h, read back from Apple's
                            own UniformTypeIdentifiers framework.

                            NOTE: public.png and public.jpeg are the values measured on
                            this wire, both to a Mac. Every other one is sent because you
                            asked for it, not because a peer is known to take it --
                            whether the Accept dialog appears for it, and where the file
                            lands afterwards, is unmeasured, and so is any type to an
                            iPhone. A peer that will not have it shows up as failed_in ==
                            AD_SEND_ASK, and the staged SEND-TYPE line says what was
                            declared.                                                    */
