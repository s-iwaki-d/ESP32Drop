/* BLEAdvMin.cpp -- bundled with ESP32Drop, same 0BSD terms as the rest of the library.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE WHOLE FILE IS BEHIND ESP32DROP_SENDER, and that is not tidiness.
 *
 * Arduino compiles every .cpp under a library's src/ whatever the sketch defines, so a
 * guard around the declarations would not be enough: this file defines
 *
 *     extern "C" bool btInUse(void) { return true; }
 *
 * which overrides a weak symbol in the Arduino core and stops it releasing the BT
 * controller's memory before setup(). That is exactly right for a sender and exactly wrong
 * for everyone else -- a sketch that only RECEIVES AirDrop would silently give up about
 * 36 KB of internal DRAM to a radio it never turns on, in a library whose whole argument is
 * that the application must be left real memory. Compiling to nothing is the only way a
 * receiving build carries none of it.
 *
 * Define ESP32DROP_SENDER (or -DESP32DROP_SENDER) to build the sender. The GreetingCard
 * example does.

/* ---- Keeping the BLE memory alive -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THIS IS THE PART THAT MAKES OR BREAKS THE WHOLE FILE. The Arduino core frees the BT
 * controller's ~36 KB back to the general heap BEFORE setup() runs, unless something in
 * the image declares that a BLE library is linked (esp32-hal-misc.c, initArduino()).
 * Calling esp_bt_controller_init() after that release does not return an error — it
 * initialises a controller on top of memory the heap has already handed out, and on an
 * S3 that HANGS. Three separate hypotheses were measured and refuted before this was
 * found.
 *
 * Core 3.x provides the intended mechanism: a header whose constructor sets
 * _bleLibraryInUse, which the core's weak bleInUse() returns. Older cores only had the
 * now-deprecated btInUse() weak symbol, so that is the fallback.
 *
 * ⚠️ This must live in a translation unit the linker actually pulls in. It is in the same
 *    file as bleadv_begin() for exactly that reason — put it in a file of its own and an
 *    archived object providing nothing else could be dropped, silently, with the only
 *    symptom being a hang. */
