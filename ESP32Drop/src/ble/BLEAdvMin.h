// BLEAdvMin — advertise, and nothing else.
//
// A BLE broadcaster for ESP32-C3/S3 built out of four standard HCI commands sent over
// Espressif's own VHCI transport. There is no host stack: no GAP, no GATT, no L2CAP, no
// security manager, no connection state. The device transmits ADV_NONCONN_IND and never
// listens.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The platform's BLE entry point (NimBLE, or Bluedroid on ESP32) brings
// up a full dual-role host. Measured on an M5Stack StopWatch (ESP32-S3), NimBLE costs
// 71,764 B of internal RAM. Half of that is the host, and a beacon uses none of it.
// This path costs 26,620 B measured, for identical observable behaviour.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a from-scratch BLE implementation. The link layer is
// Espressif's precompiled controller (libble_app.a) — the same one NimBLE drives. What is
// skipped is only the host library above it. Going below ~26 KB means either rebuilding
// the IDF controller or programming the BLE MAC registers directly, which Espressif does
// not document, so 26 KB is the floor and there is nothing left to trim.
//
// The controller's cost was measured twice, in two trees, and agrees: 26,452 B standalone,
// 26,620 B here. ad_cycle.cpp uses that: it reads the heap after starting the advertiser
// and treats a controller that took no memory as a failure, because begin() and enable()
// both return OK whether or not the radio actually came up.
//
// end() gives it all back. Twenty start/stop cycles leave 248 B in 3 blocks and return the
// largest free block exactly to its baseline -- so the advertiser can be cycled against
// AWDL, which is what ad_cycle.cpp does, without fragmenting the arena TLS needs.
