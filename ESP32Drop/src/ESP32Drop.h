/* ESP32Drop.h -- AirDrop on the ESP32-S3: receive files from an iPhone or a Mac, or send a
 * file to one.
 *
 * Include this one header. It pulls in ESP32AWDL.h, because AirDrop over AWDL is not a
 * protocol you can run on ordinary Wi-Fi: the link layer underneath takes the radio
 * exclusively and cannot coexist with WiFi.begin(). If that is a problem for your
 * project, it is a problem you should discover here rather than three days in.
 *
 * Two roles, one per build. ad_begin(), ad_on_file() and ad_poll() receive;
 * ad_sender_begin(), ad_send() and ad_send_poll() send, and the sending modules compile only
 * when ESP32DROP_SENDER is defined -- in a build_opt.h beside the sketch, so the library
 * sees it too. A device cannot do both: a listener task's stack and a TLS client context
 * do not both fit beside AWDL. See examples/PrintReceivedFiles and examples/GreetingCard.
 *
 * The API is the C surface declared in the headers below. A C++ wrapper is planned on top
 * of it.
