/* awdl_frame.h -- build an AWDL Master Indication Frame.
 *
 * This is the byte-for-byte frame that makes an Apple device accept us as a peer, and
 * it was already written as pure code: 178 lines with exactly two platform calls, both
 * of them clock reads, and four globals it happened to reach for instead of taking as
 * arguments. Extracting it was argument-passing, not porting -- the translation from
 * the firmware's build_mif was done by script and its diff is nothing but parameter
 * renames, so the bytes cannot have moved. tools/test-frame.sh proves that: it holds
 * golden vectors produced by the pre-extraction implementation and requires this one to
 * reproduce them exactly.
 *
 * WHY THIS FRAME IS DELICATE
 *
 * Per OWL's rx.c a peer only becomes connectable once it has seen a MIF *and* a valid
 * version/devclass, so every TLV in the chain has to parse. The TLV lengths here are
 * HAND-WRITTEN LITERALS: a wrong one does not fail loudly, it shifts every following
 * TLV and the peer silently stops reading the chain. That has happened. Three lengths
 * move together whenever the TXT string changes (the TLV length, the record data_len,
 * and the label length), and tools/frame_test.c walks the chain the way a peer does and
 * says where it breaks. Run tools/test-frame.sh after touching anything here.
 *
 * Two things in the payload are not arbitrary and were paid for:
 *
 *   - We advertise ourselves as a LEAF (distance_to_master = 1) with a deliberately
 *     weak self_metric, echoing the elected root's real address, metric and counter.
 *     An earlier frame claimed distancetop = 0 -- "I am the root" -- while pointing
 *     top_master at a foreign MAC with a counter frozen at 0; iOS read that as
 *     out-of-mesh and never peered.
 *   - The service_response TLVs announce _airdrop._tcp AT THE AWDL LAYER. iOS builds
 *     its AirDrop candidate list from the action frame, not only from mDNS. Their name
 *     compression is a fixed dictionary (C0 07 = _airdrop._tcp.local, C0 0C = local,
 *     C0 00 = root) validated byte-for-byte against a real Mac's on-air TLVs. That
 *     validation covers _airdrop and nothing else, so this encoder is deliberately
 *     specific rather than a general DNS-SD-over-AWDL writer.
 *
 * Dependency-free integer C: it compiles unchanged into the firmware and into
 * tools/test-frame.sh.

/* Buffer floor the caller must provide. The builder emits a variable-length frame and

 * against a caller who passed a buffer too small for a frame whose size is known in
 * advance. Requiring one generous minimum is the honest contract instead. Measured
 * output is 401 bytes for a 12-character instance; the arpa TLV is the only

 * PARSING
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The receive half. These read the frames the mesh sends us, and everything they
 * produce feeds either the phase gauge or the master table -- and the master table
 * drives the election, which is where this project's two worst outages came from.
 * Both were found by a human noticing the badge had vanished from AirDrop. So the
 * decoders are pure functions with fixtures, like awdl_elect.h, rather than code that
 * can only be exercised on the device.
 *
 * ONE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE from the firmware they replace, deliberate: the sync-params
 * decoder checks its length. handle_sync() read val[21..26] as the master address and
 * val[29..30] as the AW sequence with NO length guard at all, while the election-v1,
 * election-v2 and chanseq handlers next to it all guarded theirs. The TLV walk bounds
 * the read to the frame buffer, so it was never a crash -- but a peer emitting a short
 * sync TLV would have had six bytes of whatever followed registered as a master
 * address, in the table the election chooses from. Now it is rejected.
