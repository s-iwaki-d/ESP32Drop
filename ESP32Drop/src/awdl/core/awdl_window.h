/* awdl_window.h -- the AWDL wire and timing constants.

 * the window arithmetic, their host tests -- is dependency-free C in the house style.
 * Duplicating the constants into each of those would be the obvious mistake: AW_US and
 * AWC_US are load-bearing for the gauge, the TX gate and the MIF's live timing fields
 * at once, and two copies is one copy that can drift.
 *
 * The window ARITHMETIC (slot/mask/phase, and the next-window-opens-in function the
 * cadence needs) lives here as well, below the constants.

 * One AW is 16 TU; one availability-window cycle (AWC) is 64 AW. The chanseq
 * divides the AWC into 16 slots of 4 AW each, so one slot is 65,536 us and the mesh
 * typically grants exactly one of them on ch6 -- a 6.25% raw duty cycle, 5.01% after
 * the lead-in and end guard. Every latency budget in this project derives from that.
 *
 * AWC_US == 1048576 == 2^20 exactly, and 2^32 is a multiple of 2^20, so modular
 * arithmetic on 32-bit rx timestamps is exact across their wrap. handle_sync relies

 * only thing standing between the badge and being invisible: gate too tightly and the
 * MIF never leaves, gate on the wrong slot and it leaves into an empty window. Both have
 * happened. So it lives here, as pure functions of (phase, mask), exercised on a host
 * against a scriptable clock rather than only on the device.
 *
 * `phase` is the position within the AWC, in microseconds, that the caller derives from
 * the PLL. Keeping it an argument is what makes this testable at all -- the clock and the
 * lock live in the port.
 *
 * LEAD and GUARD apply only at the edges of a RUN of ch6 slots, never between adjacent
 * ones: the mesh densifies ch6 under traffic (1/16 to 5/16 observed during a transfer)
 * and treating each slot in a run as separately guarded would throw that airtime away.

 * between the two pairs a fresh phase with the PREVIOUS election's mask, which aims the
 * transmit window at a slot the new master does not listen on. Today both writer and
 * readers are on core 1 at priority 1, so the gap is only reachable via preemption by
 * awdl_proc; once the cadence task exists the publisher is priority 2 and the loop()-side
 * readers are priority 1, and a reader preempted mid-copy becomes routine.
 *
 * The doubles are the sharp edge. A double torn WITHIN one exponent is off by at most half
 * a microsecond and nobody would ever notice. Torn ACROSS an exponent change -- new
 * exponent, stale mantissa -- it is unbounded, up to a whole 1,048,576 us cycle, and the
 * PLL's fmod wrap makes exponent crossings routine near zero. That is not a tear you
 * recover from: it is a transmit into an empty slot, which is the failure this project has
 * already spent 4,125 frames on.
