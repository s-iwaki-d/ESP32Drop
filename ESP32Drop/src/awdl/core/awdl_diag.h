/* awdl_diag.h -- the AWDL layer's counters, in one object.
 *
 * These are NOT the public API. awdl_status.h is: a small, curated set with the derived
 * questions already answered. This is the raw instrument panel, for the diagnostics
 * example and for the soak analysis in tools/ -- the numbers you want when something is
 * wrong and you do not yet know what.
 *
 * They live in ONE struct rather than as thirty-odd file-scope globals, and that is a
 * boundary decision before it is a tidiness one. As separate symbols -- written by the
 * AWDL layer, read by the caller's status line -- they make the seam between the two look
 * fifty symbols wide when the functional seam is about ten. The rest is the instrument
 * panel reaching through the wall, and a library cannot be extracted across a seam that
 * wide.
 *
 * Everything here is written by exactly one task and read by another, so the fields are
 * volatile where they are counters. None of them is load-bearing: losing an increment
 * costs a diagnostic, never a frame.

/* THE DETAIL SET IS OPT-IN, and the default is off.
 *
 * A few of the instruments below are not paid for by what they compute but by WHERE they
 * run. Two sit on the frame path; one of those two sits INSIDE the g_mux critical section,
 * which the election and the caller's status line both queue behind; and one sits between
 * build_mif() and esp_wifi_80211_tx(), so it delays the very transmission whose placement
 * it is measuring. Everything else here is an increment on a path that was already going
 * to run, and stays compiled in unconditionally.
 *
 * Build with -DAWDL_DIAG_DETAIL=1 to install them for a session. With it off the fields
 * stay zero and every consumer still compiles unchanged: a counter that is never
 * incremented reads 0, which is exactly what a status line should print for an instrument
 * that is not installed. The fields it governs are marked DETAIL below; the producers are
 * in awdl_port_esp32.cpp, each with the cost that put it behind this switch.

       is 1460 -- see AWDL_NETIF_MTU.

       ADDR1. It refuses a DATA frame whose addr1 is a group address and lets a unicast one
       through; ACTION frames are exempt. Splitting the
       refusals by addr1 says immediately whether a stalled upload lost ITS OWN data frames
       or lost the IPv6 neighbour-discovery traffic underneath them.
