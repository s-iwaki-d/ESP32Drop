// Its history is the reason for that judgement. Electing by METRIC tracked whichever
// peer momentarily claimed the biggest number and flapped 842 times in four minutes,
// and the badge left the Mac's AWDL peer table exactly when we began advertising that
// peer. Latching a decision "because it is a constant" left the gauge 131ms out and
// the badge invisible for hours. Both were found by a human noticing the badge had
// vanished -- not by a test. This header exists so the next change to the rules can
// be argued about against fixtures instead.
//
// What is IN here: eligibility (staleness, sample count, self, trust) and the choice
// (lowest inter-announcement gap, metric as tie-break, stdev as second tie-break,
// hysteresis for the incumbent). What is deliberately OUT: the phase statistics, the
// global PLL, the channel mask, and everything else select_master() does with the
// winner -- those need the firmware's clocks and rings, and none of them changes
// which candidate wins.
