/* awdl_src.h -- per-SENDER residual statistics.
 *
 * Keyed by the transmitting MAC (pl[10..15]), NOT by the announced sync master the way
 * awdl_peer.h is. The two keys are genuinely different and the difference was measured:
 * every sender announces the same master, but each carries its own TSF epoch -- three
 * senders sat at -180 ms / +14 ms / +275 ms of each other, and EHIST showed exactly three
 * spikes, each under 2 ms wide. A table keyed by the announced master cannot separate
 * them, which is how 977 samples came to be rejected as outliers and the lock duty sat at
 * 83%.
 *
 * What it holds now is diagnostic: the innovation mean and spread per sender (the ESRC
 * line) and each sender's phase histogram at one-AW resolution over the 64-AW cycle (the
 * SHIST line). The histogram settled a real question -- whether the channel sequence
 * advances one AW per step or four -- by showing every sender peaking in the same single
 * place rather than every 16 bins. The answer is 64 AW.
 *
 * Dependency-free C over plain buffers so the same code compiles into both firmwares and
 * into tools/test-src.sh.

 * MEASURED against a two-pass reference over the same samples
 * (tools/test-src.sh):
 *
 *   offset 275,000 us, sd 17 us   -- the worst real sender epoch this project has seen --
 *                                    one-pass 296.832 vs two-pass 296.833. Six digits.
 *   offset 9 us, sd 8.6 us        -- the typical case --  74.6729 vs 74.6729. Exact.
 *   offset 275,000 us, sd 0.006 us -- one-pass goes NEGATIVE (-9.77e-05) and sqrt is NaN.
 *
 * So the one-pass form is fine everywhere this firmware operates: the innovation is
 * wrapped into +/-AWC/2 = +/-524,288 us before it ever gets here, which bounds the term
 * that cancels, and a real sender's spread is tens of microseconds, not hundredths. The
 * clamp below is not fixing an observed failure -- it costs one compare and removes the
 * only way this can return NaN, which matters because the sender it would misprint for is
 * the one furthest out, i.e. the one worth looking at.
