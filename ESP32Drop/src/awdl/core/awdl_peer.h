/* awdl_peer.h -- the mesh-wide window PLL.
 *
 * AWDL synchronises the whole vicinity to ONE availability-window schedule, so every
 * master's sync frame measures the SAME window phase. This tracks that one phase, and
 * everything downstream depends on it: the transmit gate in awdl_window.h asks where in
 * the cycle we are, and if this answer drifts the badge transmits into an empty slot.
 * That has happened -- 8 AW out, 131 ms, 4,125 frames into a window nobody was listening
 * on, found only because a human noticed the badge had left the AirDrop UI.
 *
 * It is a single global loop on purpose. A per-master PLL was tried and reset itself every
 * time the election flapped between equally-synced masters, which dropped the lock -- and
 * therefore the TX timing -- whenever nearby Apple devices woke up and churned the
 * election.
 *
 * The constants are tuned on hardware and each one has a measured failure behind it:
 *   KP 0.06 / KI 2e-10   phase and drift gains; the integral gain is small because the
 *                        drift is slow (measured 0.1-38 ppm against the elected master)
 *   OUTLIER 15,000 us    innovations beyond this are not measurements, they are a
 *                        different mesh or a re-based TSF
 *   8 consecutive misses re-seed. A regime change must be followed, but not instantly:
 *                        one jitter observation once became a permanent latch and left
 *                        the gauge 131 ms out for hours.
 *   WANDER 1,500 us      "locked" means the SMOOTHED track is stable, not that the last
 *                        sample was close
 *
 * Dependency-free apart from <math.h> for fmod/fabs: it compiles unchanged into the
 * firmware and into tools/test-peer.sh, where the sample stream and its timestamps are
 * scripted.
