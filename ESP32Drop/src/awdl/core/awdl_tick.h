/* awdl_tick.h -- when to transmit, decided against the window rather than against a timer.
 *
 * THE THING THIS REPLACES, AND WHY. The first version of this header ran the cadence off
 * relative deadlines -- "15 ms since the last MIF" -- which is what loop() had always done.
 * Simulated against measured blocking and one tick of wake jitter, a 5 ms relative tick
 * delivers 3.43 MIF per window against the 3.58 loop() already manages. It is worse than
 * doing nothing. The reason is that a relative deadline has no idea where the window is:
 * every delay pushes the whole train later, and the frames fall off the end of a window
 * that does not move.
 *
 * So the schedule is ANCHORED to the window. The k-th frame of a run goes out at
 * run_open + k * 15,000 us, an absolute instant. If a pass is late, the missed instants are
 * skipped and COUNTED -- the grid is never re-anchored to "now", because re-anchoring is
 * how a late pass turns into a permanently shifted train.
 *
 * WHAT GATES A MIF: the window is open, and this instant has not been sent. Nothing else.
 * In particular NOT "is there time left for the worst-case injection" -- the 12,000 us
 * guard at the end of every run exists precisely to absorb that injection, whose worst
 * measured value is 7,073 us, a 1.70x margin. Testing for it again on top of the guard
 * double-counts it, and turns the last instant of a width-1 run into a coin flip: it has
 * 463 us of nominal margin, less than the wake jitter.
 *
 * The netif drain is different and DOES get that test, per frame. It has 3.7-15x throughput
 * headroom, so declining a frame costs nothing, and it must also stop before the next MIF
 * instant -- otherwise a mid-window wake front-loads sixteen frames into the shared driver
 * queue directly ahead of the frame that keeps the badge visible.
 *
 * Pure: no clock of its own, no globals, no Serial, no allocation. Everything it needs is
 * an argument, which is what lets tools/test-tick.sh replay a real window schedule against
 * it with injected jitter and injected per-transmit costs.
