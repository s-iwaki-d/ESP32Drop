/* awdl_status.h -- what a library user is allowed to ask, and how to read the answer.
 *
 * This is a PULL API on purpose. There is no log sink and no callback here: library tasks
 * run at priorities where a user's code must never execute, so nothing this header exposes
 * can put the caller on the cadence task, the frame task or the TLS task. You ask; you are
 * answered from a snapshot.
 *
 * The hard part of a status API is not the fields, it is refusing to make the caller an
 * expert. "Is my badge discoverable right now" has one answer, not eleven, and a user who
 * has to compare mif_sent against a ceiling they compute themselves from a channel mask
 * will get it wrong. So the derived questions are answered here, tested, once -- and the
 * raw fields are there underneath for anyone who wants them.
 *
 * Dependency-free integer C plus the window arithmetic, so the same code compiles into the
 * firmware and into tools/test-status.sh.
