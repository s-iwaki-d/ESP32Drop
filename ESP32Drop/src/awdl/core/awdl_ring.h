/* awdl_ring.h -- the single-producer/single-consumer cursor both rings share.
 *
 * Two rings in this library have the same shape and the same discipline: the frame ring
 * (WiFi callback on core 0 produces, awdl_proc on core 1 consumes) and the diagnostic dump
 * ring (awdl_proc produces, the application consumes through awdl_diag_read_line()).
 * Neither may block. The producer sits on the frame path, where the entire budget is
 * microseconds and where a stall costs a transmit window; the consumer is on the far side
 * of the library, holding a UART that has been measured stalling for 250 ms.
 *
 * So when the ring is full the producer DROPS and counts. That is not a compromise, it is
 * the requirement: waiting for the consumer would reintroduce exactly the stall the ring
 * exists to remove. `drops` is the honest record of it, and both rings report it.
 *
 * This header owns only the cursor arithmetic -- the element arrays stay with the caller,
 * so the payload is never reached through a pointer this code chose, and nothing is added
 * to the hot path but an index.
 *
 * ---- the protocol, which is the part worth stating once instead of twice -------------
 *
 *   producer:  i = awdl_ring_reserve(r);   if (i < 0) it is full and already counted
 *              ...fill slot[i]...
 *              awdl_ring_commit(r);        publishes it. NOT before the fill.
 *
 *   consumer:  i = awdl_ring_peek(r);      if (i < 0) it is empty
 *              ...consume slot[i]...
 *              awdl_ring_release(r);       frees it. NOT before the consume.
 *
 * head is written last on the producer side and tail last on the consumer side, so neither
 * ever observes a slot the other is still working on. Capacity is slots-1: the state
 * (head+1 == tail) is what distinguishes full from empty, and spending one slot on that is
 * cheaper than a separate count that would itself need to be shared.
 *
 * ---- why the barriers ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `volatile` orders volatile accesses against each other and nothing else. The slot fill
 * is an ordinary memcpy, so a compiler is within its rights to sink part of it past the
 * volatile store that publishes the slot -- at which point the consumer reads a slot the
 * producer has not finished writing. No compiler has done that to us yet, and "not yet"
 * is not the same as correct: this is library code, compiled by toolchains this project
 * will never see.
 *
 * The fix is a compiler barrier, and it is FREE: it emits no instruction, it only forbids
 * the reordering. Measured -- both images are byte-identical in size with and without it.
 *
 * The index arithmetic masks with a runtime field rather than a compile-time constant,
 * which costs one extra load on the frame path -- of a word sitting in the same struct as
 * head and tail, which are being loaded anyway. Measured cost across both rings: 140 bytes
 * of flash (108 mask, 28 volatile `drops`, 4 assertions), no change in RAM. Stated in full
 * because "this must not cost performance on the frame path" is a requirement here, not a
 * preference, and an unmeasured "negligible" is not an answer.
 *
 * A full hardware barrier is deliberately NOT used. The two cores reach these rings in
 * internal SRAM, which on ESP32 is not cached per core, so there is no hardware store
 * visibility problem to solve and a DMB-equivalent would cost time on the frame path for
 * nothing. If this is ever ported to a target where the producer and consumer sit behind
 * separate caches, THIS is the comment to come back to.
