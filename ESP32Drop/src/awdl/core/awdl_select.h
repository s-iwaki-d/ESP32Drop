/* awdl_select.h -- the outcome of one master election, as the rest of the system sees it.
 *
 * Split out of the repo-root awdl_sync.h at extraction step 10. It lives here rather than
 * in awdl_peer.h because it is not the peer TABLE, it is the ANSWER: one row chosen, with
 * the phase statistics and estimator quality that decided the choice attached to it. The
 * transmit path needs the answer; the diagnostics need the quality; neither needs the
 * table.
 *
 * Dependency-free: plain integers, floats and a MAC. Nothing here includes the window
 * arithmetic or the PLL, so a host test can construct one by hand.
