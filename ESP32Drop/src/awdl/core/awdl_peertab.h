/* ad_peertab.h -- who is nearby, how close, and can they receive.
 *
 * The send path needs three things about a neighbour and nothing else: its MAC (to connect
 * to), how strong its frames are (to decide it is close enough to mean it), and whether it
 * has been heard offering _airdrop._tcp (to know a transfer can even be attempted). This
 * holds exactly that.
 *
 * WHY NOT awdl_census.h. The census remembers up to six names and service types per peer
 * and measures 3,604 bytes. It exists to answer "what is on
 * this mesh" for the sniffer, which is a different question. The table here is 164 bytes --
 * 13% of it -- because it stores one name per peer and nothing it does not need. On a
 * receiver measured running with about 6 KB of headroom that difference is the whole
 * argument.
 *
 * NO DISPLAY NAME HERE, deliberately. A row is a handle for reaching a peer, not a label for
 * showing one. Apple's AWDL service records mostly carry identifiers rather than names --
 * UUIDs, TXT fragments, CLink-<hex> -- and the census-era capture rate for a real name was
 * 0 of 2 peers, so the field would have been empty in almost every row that had one. The
 * name a user should see comes from /Discover's ReceiverComputerName instead, which IS
 * measured to arrive, and which the send path already has to read. Dropping it takes a row
 * from 60 bytes to 20 and the table from 484 to 164.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY-FREE, like every other header in core/ here: no Arduino, no ESP-IDF, no allocation.
 * It compiles unchanged into the host tests (tools/test-peertab.sh), which is the only
 * reason the eviction and averaging below can be trusted without a device.

/* THE FILE IS awdl_peertab.h AND THE TYPE IS AdPeerTab, deliberately: the file is named
 * for its PRODUCER and the type for its CONSUMER. check-library.sh's rule 3 matches include
 * targets against /airdrop|ad_/, so a file called ad_peertab.h inside awdl/ trips a rule it
 * does not actually break -- and a checker that has to be argued with stops being read. The
 * names adp_ and AdPeerTab stay: they are the published surface ad_send.h uses.
 * (And note the literal that broke this comment on the way in -- "adp_*" followed by a
 *  slash closes a block comment. Two errors, neither of them where the text was.)
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN THE AWDL LAYER, having started in airdrop/core.
 *
 * The data is born here and nowhere else: RSSI exists for one instant, in the promiscuous
 * callback's rx_ctrl, with the transmitter's MAC in the frame beside it. Anything further
 * out has already lost both -- which is why the table itself sits in awdl/port. Leaving
 * the TYPE on the AirDrop side meant the link layer included an AirDrop header, and
 * tools/check-library.sh's rule 3 forbids that in every case, deliberately: the rule is
 * how an accidental coupling gets caught, and an exception nobody has to remember is
 * better than one everybody does. The AirDrop side reaches it through ESP32AWDL.h, which
 * rule 2 already permits.
 *
 * It stays dependency-free -- stdint, stdbool, string -- so it can be included from either
 * side and compiled unchanged into tools/peertab_test.c. */
