/* awdl_port_esp32.cpp -- Apple Wireless Direct Link on the ESP32 radio.
 *
 * The frame path, the mesh phase estimator, master election, the transmit cadence, the
 * raw 802.11 injection sites and the lwIP netif that rides on them. The reasoning is
 * attached to the code because every non-obvious line in this file was paid for with a
 * capture, and two of them were paid for with a badge that vanished from AirDrop for
 * 74 seconds.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and where it went. All of it is dependency-free C with a host suite,
 * which is the point of the split -- the parts that can be wrong in a way you can test on
 * a laptop are the parts that were wrong:
 *   awdl_gauge.h   the mesh-wide phase gauge      awdl_elect.h   the election decision
 *   awdl_window.h  AW/AWC arithmetic              awdl_tick.h    the cadence schedule
 *   awdl_peer.h    the master table and the PLL   awdl_frame.h   TLV parse and MIF build
 *   awdl_ring.h    the SPSC cursor                awdl_src.h     per-sender residuals
 *
 * THREE INVARIANTS. They are not style; each has a measured failure behind it.
 *   (a) NOTHING ON THE FRAME PATH MAY BLOCK. No Serial, no lwIP, no waiting. A 958-byte
 *       hex dump written directly from process_frame cost 21 ms -- longer than one AW --
 *       and hid for months because it is capped per boot. awdl_diag_stage() is the only
 *       legal diagnostic here.
 *   (b) TX IS GATED ON AN ELECTED MASTER. No master means no transmission, by design,
 *       reported rather than worked around.
 *   (c) ONE WRITER OF THE TRANSMIT GATE. The published window and selection are written
 *       only by awdl_elect_and_publish, under one critical section, and read by copy.
 *
 * A NOTE ON ARDUINO. In a .ino the build generates prototypes for every function and
 * inserts them above the body, so definition order does not matter. A .cpp has no such
 * thing, which is why this file opens with forward declarations that look redundant and
 * are not: without them, six calls and one function-pointer reference do not compile.

//
// What that buys, measured: one 958-byte hex line written directly is ~462 separate
// Serial.printf calls, and on the StopWatch Serial is TinyUSB CDC with a 64-byte TX FIFO
// whose write() busy-spins (no yield) until the host drains it, so the writer eats the
// whole drain time -- 958 B at the measured ~45 B/ms = ~21 ms. That is longer than one AW
// (16,384 us) and it stalls frame processing. The correlation is 1:1: in every dataset,
// #(dump lines) == #(proc_max spikes > 5 ms), 8/8 and 38/38.
//
// A captured payload is capped at 1500 bytes, which is what an AWDL data frame can carry.

// past the first 460.
/* PAYLOAD CAPTURE IS OPT-IN, and the default is off.
 *
 * The ring below carries two unrelated things: one-line diagnostic messages (a header and

 * bytes a slot, four slots cost 6,408 B of internal DRAM. With capture off, the receiver's
 * internal-heap low water during a real transfer is 20,880 B, and 2,088 B of added static
 * has already been enough to stop mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed (ad_port_esp32.cpp:711-715).
 *
 * Neither shipped example ever drains this ring (PrintReceivedFiles.ino:49 and
 * ShowReceivedImage.ino:104 read the AirDrop ring only), so in a default build a captured
 * payload would be written and never read. Build with -DAWDL_DIAG_PAYLOAD_MAX=1500 to
 * capture payloads for a session.
 *
 * With payloads off, a staged capture still leaves its header, which carries the length --
 * so "MDNS off=0 n=606 " with no hex after it reads as "606 bytes were there, not
 * recorded", not as "the packet was empty". */

// -Wl,-zmuldefs so the local definition beats the non-weak one. This library does neither.
//
// It was never the frame the check objected to. Disassembling it
// (libnet80211.a(ieee80211_output.o) +0x5c, 434 bytes) shows the path our frames take:
//
//   length 24..1500 ok -> interface ok -> not a protected frame -> type 0 subtype 0xd0
//   (action) accepted -> wifi_get_macaddr(ifidx) -> memcmp(own, &buf[10])
//   -> cnx_node_search(&buf[4]) -> 0x187: beqz.n a5, <log + return ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG>
//
// a5 is the FOURTH argument: en_sys_seq. Pass false -- as a raw injector naturally does --
// and the check refuses; the reason string sitting at that branch reads, verbatim from the
// blob:
//
//   "en_sys_seq should be true to avoid side-effect to WiFi connection"
//
// which is exactly what esp_wifi.h documents. Passing true is all the check ever wanted,
// and every TX site in this file does. Measured with no override and no -zmuldefs
// anywhere: MIFTX ret=ESP_OK, tx{n=567 ESP_OK}, Mac presence 100.0% over 98s, zero flaps.
//
// Two things it buys beyond the transmission itself. The driver fills the 802.11 sequence
// number when en_sys_seq is true, so hardware retransmits de-duplicate at the receiver
// instead of appearing as ping duplicates. And it removes the coexistence blocker: the
// same rule is why transmission fails outright once any Wi-Fi connection exists.
//
// It is also what makes the library distributable. library.properties CANNOT supply a
// linker flag (measured with a probe library), so a build that needed the override
// could never be a drop-in Arduino library.

  //     sender (Apple and owl alike) -- measured: 0 in essentially every frame.
  //     So that formula silently asserts "the AW boundary is exactly where this
  //     frame arrived". It is not: senders transmit at an arbitrary point inside
  //     their AW (measured `phy_tx % AW` spans 16us..16006us, i.e. the whole AW).
  //     The frame's unknown intra-AW position becomes the error, uniform over one
  //     AW. The innovation histogram shows it exactly: flat from -10ms to +12ms,
  //     not Gaussian, ~1 AW wide, per-sample stdev 5366us.
  //     Corroborating: `aw_seq - floor(phy_tx/AW)` is not constant for a sender
  //     but flips between two adjacent values ~50/50 -- the same +/-1 AW ambiguity.
  //
  //  2. Subtracting (phy_tx - tgt_tx) ADDS noise. rx_ts is simultaneous with
  //     phy_tx, not with tgt_tx: pairing rx_ts with phy_tx gives 31-43us residual
  //     stdev, pairing it with tgt_tx gives 915-1257us with a +5ms tail -- that
  //     tail IS the medium-access delay, which that correction injects.
  //
  // The mesh schedule lives in the sender's TSF, and phy_tx is that TSF at the
  // instant the frame hit the air -- the same instant our rx_ts measures. So the
  // AWC phase is simply the clock offset between us and the sender, mod AWC.
  // Measured per-sample residual: 31-43us, against 5366us for the formula above, and

       And it is ACTION frames only, not every frame: data frames leave through
       handle_data() above, which never touches this table. Real AWDL traffic is usually
       QoS Data, so a peer's RSSI stops moving for the duration of a bulk transfer. That is

   *
   * so esp_wifi_80211_tx accepts 24..1500 and refuses anything longer -- the same range
   * esp_wifi.h:1191 documents. At mtu 1500 lwIP's send MSS is 1436, and a full-MSS segment
   * becomes 1436 + 40 (IPv6) + 20 (TCP) + 40 (our 802.11/LLC/awdl_data headroom)
   * = a 1536-byte frame, which is over the limit and is dropped with no log at all
   * (CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DEBUG_PRINT is unset, so only the return value ever says so).
   * Measured: every stalled upload refused exactly those frames, unicast to the peer's own
   * MAC, next-header TCP.
   *
   * ⚠️ TWO THINGS MAKE THIS SUBTLE, and getting either wrong looks like a hang.
   *
   * 1. IT MUST RUN ON THE TCPIP THREAD. lwIP is built with CONFIG_LWIP_CHECK_THREAD_SAFETY
   *    and CONFIG_LWIP_ESP_LWIP_ASSERT, so touching a netif from another task -- calling
   *    netif_get_by_index() straight from the caller's, say -- trips
   *    LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED() -> __assert_func -> abort -> reboot. On this board that
   *    reads as a HANG rather than a panic, because the panic goes to UART0 while the
   *    console is TinyUSB CDC: nothing is printed, and the USB re-enumeration ends the
   *    capture. esp_netif_tcpip_exec() runs the callback on the tcpip thread, where the
   *    lock is held.
   *
   * 2. IPv6 READS mtu6, NOT mtu. tcp_eff_send_mss_netif -> nd6_get_destination_mtu takes
   *    netif->mtu6; netif_add merely seeds it from mtu at creation. Writing mtu alone
   *    changes nothing for the TCP that matters here. Writing BOTH also bounds any router
   *    advertisement, because nd6_input stores min(RA_mtu, netif->mtu, mtu6).
   *
   * 1280 is not the driver's limit (that would be 1460 of IPv6 payload); it is the minimum
   * MTU IPv6 guarantees and the AWDL path MTU. It gives a send MSS of 1220 and frames of
   * at most 1320 bytes, leaving 180 bytes of headroom against the real ceiling -- which is
   * the point. */
  /* NOT ignore_state(): that helper folds ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE into success and puts
     everything else in the shared tx_err latch, which send_mif overwrites four times a

 * leaves 25,424 B. Taking turns needs a way to put AWDL down, and there was none -- so a

 * reboot.
 *
 * ORDER, and each step is here because the reverse breaks something:
 *   1. the tasks, cooperatively -- they must be gone before anything they touch is freed
 *   2. the radio, before the netif -- so no frame arrives for an interface that is gone
 *   3. the netif and its 25.6 KB transmit queue
 * Steps that awdl_begin() performs with ignore_state() -- nvs_flash_init,
 * esp_netif_init, esp_event_loop_create_default -- are NOT undone. They are process-wide
 * one-time inits that other components share; tearing them down would break whoever else
 * initialised them, and begin() already tolerates finding them present.
