/* awdl_port_esp32.h -- the AWDL link layer's entry points on the ESP32 backend.
 *
 * AWDL takes the radio EXCLUSIVELY. It puts the interface in promiscuous mode, parks it on
 * channel 6, and transmits on a schedule locked to the mesh availability window. It cannot
 * coexist with WiFi.begin(), and that is not a limitation of this port: 100 % lock duty
 * requires hearing every frame on ch6.
 *
 * WHAT RUNS WHERE, because a user's task priorities can break this from outside:
 *   awdl_proc    core 1, prio 3   the frame path. Nothing on it may block.
 *   awdl_cad     core 1, prio 2   the transmit cadence. It owns presence, which is why
 *                                 your loop() may block for as long as it likes.
 *   loopTask     core 1, prio 1   yours.
 * A user task on core 1 at priority >= 3 starves the frame path; at >= 2 it starves the
 * cadence. AwdlDiag's ring_drop and AwdlStatus's win_served/win_total are how that becomes
 * visible instead of mysterious.

 * is over. A caller that ignores the return gets a device that is simply not on the air --

/* Bring the link down and hand the memory back -- the inverse of awdl_begin(), and a

 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. A device that both wakes a peer over BLE and then talks to it over AWDL
 * cannot hold both stacks at once and still leave anything for the application: measured
 * on an ESP32-S3, AWDL + the mbedTLS context + the BLE controller together leave 2,956 B
 * of internal RAM, while running them in turn leaves 25,424 B. Taking turns needs this.
 *
 * The two tasks are asked to leave and are waited for; they are never deleted from
 * outside, because the frame task takes a spinlock that no later begin() could release.
 * The radio goes down before the netif, so no frame arrives for an interface that is
 * already gone. Roughly 21.2 KB of that is the netif transmit queue alone -- sixteen slots
 * of MTU + headroom, 1,322 bytes each. It was 25.6 KB while a slot was a flat 1,600, and
 * shrinking the frame to the MTU is what returned the difference; a stale figure here would
 * have hidden the saving that change was made for.
 *
 * Returns ESP_OK, or ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE if the link was not up or a task did not
 * acknowledge within one second -- and in that case NOTHING is freed and the link keeps
 * running. Reporting a teardown that did not happen is worse than not tearing down.
 *
 * NOT undone: nvs_flash_init(), esp_netif_init() and esp_event_loop_create_default().
 * Those are process-wide and shared; begin() already tolerates finding them present. */
